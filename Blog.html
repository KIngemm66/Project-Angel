   <h3>Cybercrime in Nigeria and around the world</h3>

   <p3>In Nigeria, individuals, hackers or connected network of criminals, motivated by financial interest are the major players in the field of cybercrimes. According to the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), a gang of seven hackers, on March 10, 2018, stole 900 million naira from a single bank via malware in Lagos State.</p3>

    <h4>Causes And Effects</h4>
   <p4>With about 3.9 billion users, the internet has become one of the greatest technological developments. While widely accepted for its ease and efficiency, it is also embedded with a multitude of vulnerabilities, which pose significant security threats to users and has led to the emergence of cybercrime.

 

    Cybercrime, which includes any crime committed with the aid of a computer and network (e.g. phishing, bank verification number scams, fraudulent emails, hacking, cyber harassment, spamming, ATM spoofing, social media hi-jacking etcetera), exploits vulnerabilities of both electronic devices and their users. In Nigeria, a number of key factors - such as a high rate of unemployment, the quest for wealth, a lack of strong cybercrime laws, and incompetent security on personal devices amongst others - have coalesced to make cybercrime a significant problem for the country.The estimated annual financial loss in Nigeria due to cybercrime was N250 billion ($649 million) in 2017 and N288 billion ($800 million) in 2018.
    
     
    
    <br>Cybercrime destroys the reputation of a country, making the business environment difficult for start-ups and small and medium-sized enterprises, while discouraging investment in the economy by foreign companies. For individuals, cybercrime results in the loss of financial resources, intellectual property or personal confidential information, and the damages can be extreme, often targeting senior citizens and people who are vulnerable. In 2018, in the US, roughly 62,000 people age 60 or older reported losses totaling over $649 million.<br>
    
     
    
    This is only based on crimes reported. McAfee estimates that 95% of cybercrimes go unreported. With Nigeria venturing into a cashless society, the threat of cybercrime becomes all the more relevant. There needs to be integrated efforts between individuals, businesses, the Nigerian government and the international community. Reforms such as increasing awareness on the mode of operations of cyber criminals, improved personal security, establishment of anti-scam centers etc are vital in minimizing cybercrimes. In an effort to combat cybercrimes in Nigeria, the Central Bank of Nigeria introduced a risk-based cyber security framework and guidelines for deposit money banks and payment service providers. This framework lays out proactive steps to secure critical information assets including customer information that is accessible via the internet.
    
     
    
    There are many initiatives employed by different countries to combat cybercrimes, which Nigeria can emulate. One example is the Anti-Scam Centre in Singapore. Set up by the police in collaboration with the three major banks, the Anti-Scam Centre disrupts the operations of scammers by impeding fund transfers. In two months, the Anti-Scam Centre received 1,047 cases in which victims had lost a total of $2.4 million ($1.8 million). The centre managed to freeze 815 bank accounts and recovered 35% of the amount lost, or about S$840,000 ($623,000) - which is significantly higher than the average recovery rates for these types of scams. Similarly, Canada has an Anti-Fraud Centre which is the central agency in Canada that collects information and criminal intelligence on cybercrimes.</p4>
